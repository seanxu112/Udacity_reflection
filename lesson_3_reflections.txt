When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If I want others to work with me on the same project. It is easier to share files on github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  I may not want to always get other's contribution either because it is a feature that
  I do not want or it contains a bug.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  I can always work on it offline.
